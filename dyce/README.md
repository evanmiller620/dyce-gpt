# DyceAPI JavaScript API Library
This library provides convenient access to the Dyce API from JavaScript.


## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the way users pay for online services by introducing a cryptocurrency pay-as-you-go pricing model. Many existing subscription models, including tiered subscriptions, can be costly for users who don't fully utilize the service. Our API addresses this issue by leveraging stablecoin technology to enable direct, flexible payments based on actual usage.


## Installation
```bash
npm install dyce
```

# Dashboard API Documentation

Requests will be sent to AWS API Gateway where they will be handled by serverless lambda functions. This gateway will require the use of an API key which can be acquired by registering for one in the Dyce Dashboard.
All requests require an x-api-key header:
```json
{ "x-api-key": string }
```
